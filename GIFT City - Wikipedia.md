GIFT City is divided into two zones:

1.  Domestic Tariff Area (DTA): This zone is meant for domestic companies and is subject to Indian laws and regulations. Companies operating within this zone can cater to the domestic market and benefit from various tax incentives offered by the Indian government.
2.  Special Economic Zone (SEZ): This zone is meant for international companies and is designed to promote exports and foreign investments. Companies operating within this zone enjoy a range of incentives, including tax exemptions, duty-free imports and exports, and simplified regulatory procedures.The SEZ has been further divided into two zones: SEZ PA (Processing Area) and SEZ NPA (Non-Processing Area).
    1.  The SEZ PA is the core of the GIFT City and is designed to provide state-of-the-art infrastructure to various financial institutions, banks, and other businesses. The SEZ PA comprises commercial buildings, residential towers, a convention centre, and a recreational area. This zone is primarily intended for businesses that require specialized infrastructure, tax incentives, and other benefits provided by the SEZ Act.
    2.  On the other hand, the SEZ NPA is the area surrounding the SEZ PA and is intended to provide support services to the businesses operating in the SEZ PA. It includes residential apartments, hotels, hospitals, schools, and other support facilities.

The city is divided into the following divisions by area:

-   International Financial Services Centre (IFSC): This division is the main focus of GIFT City and is India's first IFSC. It is designed to cater to the financial services industry and provides a world-class business environment.
-   Domestic Finance Centre (DFC): This division is designed to cater to the needs of the domestic financial services industry. It provides a platform for the growth of Indian financial services companies.
-   Multi-services SEZ: This division is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) that provides a platform for companies to set up their businesses in various sectors such as IT/ITES, engineering, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals.
-   Social and Civic Infrastructure: This division provides world-class social and civic infrastructure to the residents of GIFT City, including schools, hospitals, and shopping centres.
